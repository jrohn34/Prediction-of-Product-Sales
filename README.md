# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
My project right now is to  take in data from a company and take their  sales and clean the data up. After that  we were instructed to  create graphs upon this data and analyze the graphs. My assumption is further on we will make assumptions on the Sales in the future. 
For the two visuals I have decided to go with a count plot and a box plot because the box plot shows outliers in the data. The information that I have gathered from the count plot is the majority of outlets are medium sized.
